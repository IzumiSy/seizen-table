## What is Seizen Table?

**Seizen Table** is a rich, enterprise-grade data table component for React, built on top of [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table).

The name "Seizen" (整然, /seɪˈzen/) comes from the Japanese word meaning **"orderly," "neat," or "well-organized."** It embodies the essence of **Zen** (禅)—simplicity, clarity, and mindful design. Just as Zen emphasizes removing the unnecessary to reveal what truly matters, Seizen Table aims to bring order and clarity to your data presentation with a clean, extensible architecture.

## Why Seizen Table?

Building enterprise-grade data tables from scratch is challenging. While TanStack Table provides an excellent headless foundation, there's still a significant gap between a headless library and a production-ready component that teams can use immediately.

Seizen Table bridges this gap by providing:
